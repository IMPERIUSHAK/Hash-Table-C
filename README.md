# Introduction

A hash table is a data structure which offers a fast implementation of the associative array API. 
As the terminology around hash tables can be confusing

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Supported operations:

 * `search(a, k)` : return `v` associated with `key` from associative array `a` or `NULL` if the key not found.
 * `insert(a, k, v)`: store the pair `k:v` int the associative array `a`.
 * `delete(a, k)`: delete the `k:v` pair associated with `k`, or do nothing if `k` does not exist.
